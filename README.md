### 📘 Assignment #02 – Programming of Artificial Intelligence

This repository contains the implementation and analysis of various AI programming concepts as part of Assignment #02 for the *Programming of Artificial Intelligence* course.

#### 🔍 Topics Covered:

* Data preprocessing and visualization using **Pandas**, **Seaborn**, and **Matplotlib**
* Outlier detection using standard deviation method
* Hypothesis testing with **T-test** (using `scipy.stats`)
* Chi-square test for independence
* Solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs) using:

  * `odeint` (SciPy)
  * `solve_ivp` (SciPy)

#### 📊 Key Features:

* Visualization of health-related data (Blood Pressure, Cholesterol Level) across different regions and risk categories
* Statistical inference on health datasets using hypothesis testing
* Side-by-side comparison of numerical ODE solvers with graphical results

#### 📁 Requirements:

* Python 3.x
* Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`, `scipy`

#### 💻 How to Run:

Make sure all required libraries are installed, then open and run the notebook using Jupyter:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```
